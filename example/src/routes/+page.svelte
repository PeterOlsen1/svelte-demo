        Welcome to Mullet Bullet's Interactive Svelte Documentation!

    <p>
        As a part of our tech share on svelte, we thought it would be important to compile some
        of Svelte's best features into one webapp.

        As an important aside, <em>Svelte</em> and <em>SvelteKit</em> are two different things.
        <br>
        This website only covers <em>Svelte</em> basics, which are essentially most of the tools you need for
        frontend success. <em>SvelteKit</em> on the other hand, is a metaframework that deals with
        the deployment, adminstration, etc. of svelte projects.

    <h2>Why Svelte?</h2>
    <p>
        Svelte is a framework that greatly improves the developer experience, with simple build in functions to ease DOM manipulation. Svelte is compiled into optimized JavaScript which updates the DOM directly, instead of some virtual DOM.
        This means that Svelte apps have massive performance gains over frameworks with a virtual DOM.
        <br><br>
        Svelte files also allow for developers to include CSS, JS, and HTML all in one file, with out of the box for TS, SCSS, and SASS, for those who are a little more ambitious.
