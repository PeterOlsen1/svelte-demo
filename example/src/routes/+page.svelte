        Welcome to Mullet Bullet's Interactive Svelte Documentation!

        As a part of our tech share on svelte, we thought it would be important to compile some
        of Svelte's best features into one webapp.

        As an important aside, <em>Svelte</em> and <em>SvelteKit</em> are two different things.
        <br>
        This website only covers <em>Svelte</em> basics, which are essentially most of the tools you need for
        frontend success. <em>SvelteKit</em> on the other hand, is a metaframework that deals with
        the deployment, adminstration, etc. of svelte projects.
