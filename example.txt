First run 'npx sv create {name}'
Next, navigate into the '{name}' directory
Run {package manager} run dev to start the server, and navigate to localhost:5173

Why svelte:
    Tired of react and random hooks, svelte has cleaner syntax
    When developing a svelte project, using the 'run dev' command will automatically refresh the page
    We can compile svelte into optimized javascript using the 'run build' command

    Bundle size is way smaller than other frameworks, lightweight!

Runes (new with svelte 5.0!):
    $state():
        Keeps track of a variable and updates references to it on the page when the given variable is updated

    $props():
        input to a component, like <Component val='hello' val2='hello2'>
        then, let { val, otherVal } = $props()

    

    


Routes:
    Routing is very simple.
    Svelte uses file system based routing, so we can throw a new directory in our ./routes directory
    Name it whatever, and add a +page.svelte file in there, and it will register with the route 
    for the directory name
